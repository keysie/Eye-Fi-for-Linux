Eye-Fi for Linux Package
by Keysie, 2015
========================

EyeFi-Config:
**************

This tool is used to configure the SD-Card as well as
read its logfile. Simply execute 'make' inside the
'EyeFi-Config'-folder and you're good to go. The README
inside the folder provides a list of possible commands.
To configure the card it should be plugged into the 
computer, not be connected wirelessly.

EyeFi-Server:
**************

(This part of the package is not developed or maintained by me)
This is the server application used to intercept the data sent
by the card. To install, use the install.sh script. It will ask
for Settings.xml and a path where to store the fotos, as well as
in some cases who is the default user of eyefiserver. Settings.xml
has to be optained by activating the Eye-Fi Card on a Windows 8/10...
machine with the official Eye-Fi software. After successful
activation, the software will store the file under this path:
'C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Eye-Fi\'. It contains the card's 
ESSID and WPA2-key in case the card is able to host its own network,
as well as the upload-key. It's easiest to place Settings.xml in
the 'EyeFi-Server' subfolder, replacing the example-file provided
with this package. Like this, you do not have to specify the path
during installation.

If your card does not have the capability to host its own wifi, use
the script and config file in the folder 'Local-AP'. You may have to
tweak some things depending on your OS and hardware.

!NOTE! This seems not to be working at the moment. Host a wlan for
the card to log into, then the server works fine.

After a successful installation the server will start in verbose mode
in the console.

Installation-path is /usr/local/eyefiserver. Use the start- and
stop scripts for convenient handling. Run all scripts as sudo.

start.sh will normally start the server in background; use stop.sh
to shut it down. If you want to start it inside the console in
verbose mode, use start.sh -v
 
DeepSkyStacker:
****************

Install using wine. BEFORE installation of setup.exe, you have to
install vcredist_x86.exe. After installation, you can use the
DeepSkyStackerLive.exe to watch the upload-folder of the eyefi-
server for new images and continuously stack them to get an idea of
the final image. I recommend using this live version only for a
preview, and still take the time to process a real image on a windows
machine or in a virtual box using DeepSkyStacker.exe. Especially,
if you have the EyeFi card only transmit jpegs and not raws.

If you install DeepSkyStacker in wine using the standard location,
you can use the Start-DSS-Live.sh script to start DeepSkyStackerLive
without having to cd to the file's location every time.

NOTE: It seems that DSS is not working well with wine, therefore
I am currently testing different other possibilities to achieve
this functionality. Right now it looks like the best solution
would be to have a windows virtual machine run concurrently with
everything else and have DSS-Live run inside the VM.
